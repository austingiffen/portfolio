  <section id="about" class="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    I’m an electrical engineering student at Yale with a lifelong passion for physics, problem-solving, and exploring the intricate systems that shape our world. Whether I’m designing experiments to improve solar cell efficiency or building data systems from the ground up, I love diving deep into challenges that demand both technical skill and creative thinking. Beyond academics, I’m driven by a desire to contribute to meaningful causes—especially those at the intersection of environmental sustainability and humanitarian impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside the lab, I’m an outgoing and energetic person who loves saying “yes” to big, sometimes intimidating adventures—running a spontaneous marathon, skydiving, launching a startup, or volunteering in Ecuador on sustainable agriculture projects. I’m also a classically trained pianist, a competitive tennis player, and a sailing instructor. No matter the setting—lab, lake, concert hall, or community center—I’m always seeking growth, connection, and a way to make a positive difference.

  <h2>Work Experience</h2>
  <div class="job-entry">
    <h3>Summer Research Intern – Solar Materials Lab</h3>
    <p><strong>Institution:</strong> [Your University or Lab Name]</p>
    <p><strong>Project:</strong> Improving the efficiency of solar cells by exploring Copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) as an alternative hole transport layer (HTL) to PEDOT:PSS.</p>
    <p>
      Designed and conducted experiments to analyze the conductivity of CuSCN under various environmental conditions such as exposure to hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and vacuum. Built hardware systems using Arduino and mass flow controllers, developed LabVIEW interfaces, and wrote Python scripts to automate data analysis and visualize results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Investigated discrepancies in hydrogen doping results compared to published literature and identified the role of electrode spacing in conductivity enhancement. Findings indicated long-term air exposure significantly increased conductivity, suggesting new directions for HTL research.
